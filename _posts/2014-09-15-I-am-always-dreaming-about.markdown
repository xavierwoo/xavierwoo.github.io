From playing simcity so many years, I found the game was not so good in my eyes.
What I want is a city building game that is a combination of simcity4 and cities in motion.
I have thinked about it for one year.
May be I can build this game myself.

A city building game with live traffics, the data can be detailed to individual.
The terrain transformation ability is a must.
The buildings grow automatically, and every one have a relatively stable home and work place.(The communication in simcity 2013 is really weird that people changes their home and work places every day...)

So I began to find a tool to help me realize this thing.
I was thinking about using OpenGL, and building the hole thing from scratch.
But later I found this is unrealistic.
Then I stopped thinking about re-inventing the wheels.
After comparing a lot of 3d engines, I observed [JMonkey].
May be it is the sword that can help me slay the dragon.

If I really build this game, I may publish it in GPL licence.
Because I have not the ability to build 3d models.
I hope there will be other people, who will help me with this.

But first, I have to learn how to use JME.

Bless me!
